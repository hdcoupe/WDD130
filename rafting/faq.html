        <p>Common questions we get asked about our rivers is 'how safe are they?' 'Is your company beginner friendly?'
            We are here to answer those questions and alleviate your worries.
            Our rivers are completely safe for begginers to use, our guided experts will be able to train you and make
            sure you know how the rafting adventure will operate.
            As for questions about our pricing, our prices will vary depending on the trip you take, and how much
            equipment you need to borrow such as a life vest. Our one day rafting trip costs 65 dollars per person.
            Our two day trip is 85 dollars per person and our three day adventure is 100 dollars per person. If you need
            a life vest that will cost in extra 10 dollars in equipment fee and the price is the same for each of our
            river adventures.

                <p>During our river trips we get asked how many rivers there are that we take people down, we currently
                    offer
                    two rivers that our close to our base of operations. One river we recommend for begginers as it is
                    much more
                    calm than our other river, which we recommend for our intermediate to advanced rafters</p>
