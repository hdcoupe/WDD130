            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <p>
                We have many different situations that you can raft in, if you are a beginner, we recommend you start at
                our beginner
                course where we take you down the river when there are no rapids, it's more like a lazy river where we
                can teach you the basics of
                steering the raft with your team.
                We also offer an intermediate level where a guide will take you down the river with the rapids ranging
                between class 3 and 4
                this intermediate level has more obstructions in the water that you will need to avoid.
                And for you all rafting experts we have everything for you, we can take you on a private expedition with
                rapids that are
                class 4 and 5, you'll have a blast speeding down the river with a team of other experienced rafters
                working along side you.
